	    <Text><![CDATA[A 2006 study suggested plants could account for almost half of the global production of the greenhouse gas.<br/><br/>But a UK-based team now reports that under normal conditions, plants just convey methane from the soil to the air without actually producing it.<br/><br/>Writing in a Royal Society journal, they suggest identifying sources of methane is key for climate control.<br/><br/>The gas is about 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of its warming effect.<br/><br/>After remaining stable for almost a decade, there have been signs in the last two years that concentrations have begun to grow again, which according to some observers presages an era of faster-rising temperatures.]]></Text>

	    <Text><![CDATA[The latest deadline set by the Nigerian government to stop flaring natural gas from oil wells in the Niger Delta has passed without stopping the flames, which campaigners say are poisoning local people.<br/><br/>"Sometimes you can't tell whether it's the dawn breaking or the flame," says activist Vivian Bellonwu, the frustration clear in her voice, after seeing nothing change despite the 1 January target.<br/><br/>"It's a history of shifting goal posts, missing deadline after deadline".<br/><br/>Everyone agrees gas flaring wastes billions of dollars in useful gas. ]]></Text>

	    <Source><![CDATA[BBC News]]></Source>
	    <Text><![CDATA[The resolution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been given a massive boost by a team at computer giant IBM.<br/><br/>MRI is used as an imaging technique in medicine to visualise the internal structure of the human body.<br/><br/>The researchers demonstrated this imaging at a resolution 100 million times finer than current MRI.<br/><br/>The advance could lead to important medical applications and is powerful enough to see bacteria, viruses and proteins, say the researchers.<br/><br/>The researchers said it offered the ability to study complex 3D structures at the "nano" scale.<br/><br/>The step forward was made possible by a technique called magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM), which relies on detecting very small magnetic forces. ]]></Text>

	    <Text><![CDATA[Chemicals which can cause serious illnesses have been banned from use in pesticides by MEPs in Strasbourg.<br/><br/>The 22 substances are linked to cancer, can damage the reproductive and nervous systems, and also disrupt hormones.<br/><br/>The argument over their use has been raging for years, and the battle to get the ban approved in the European Parliament saw a huge lobbying campaign by farming groups as well as the chemical companies that manufacture pesticides.<br/><br/>Dire warnings were issued about the collapse in Europe's agricultural production should the legislation go ahead - a 100% fall in carrot production in the UK alone; a devastating effect on pea production; problems for farmers growing wheat and potatoes.<br/><br/>In turn, said the farmers, this would lead to rising prices, just as consumers are looking down the barrel of a nasty recession and concern over world food shortages is growing. ]]></Text>

	    <Source><![CDATA[BBC News]]></Source>
	    <Text><![CDATA[Dr Peter Kohl has a big idea for the future of heart surgery.<br/><br/>A patient needing an immediate operation will have a scan and in the 45 minutes it takes for blood test results to come back, surgeons will have simulated alternative operations using computer models, and know the best way to proceed.<br/><br/>They will have investigated different surgical scenarios in virtual reality and will understand the effects these have on the individual's heart.<br/><br/>For example, they will know the optimum place to fit stimulation leads that are tailored to improve that patient's heartbeat.<br/><br/>And they will have gained vital insight into how blood flow is affected when a tube is inserted to re-open a blocked vessel and decide the best location for it in that person.<br/><br/>All this, they are confident, will result in a faster procedure, when time is of the essence, and less trauma to the patient's body through prior experimentation on the virtual surgical table.<br/><br/>How long does Dr Kohl, a physiologist at Oxford University, think this idea will become reality? ]]></Text>
